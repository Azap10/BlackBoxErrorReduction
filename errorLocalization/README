This directory contains two programs, mpfrErrorLocalization requires the MPFR library to be
installed on the machine in order to run. Both programs can be compiled by running `make`

errorLocalization uses the comparison of the difference of squares with its rewritten
counterpart (error-free) to try to track sources of error. mpfrErrorLocalization is a similar
program which uses comparison to a 200-bit MPFR representation in order to achieve a similar
effect, though its methods are more broadly applicable without requiring specific knowledge of
rewrite rules.

errorLocalization can be run simply with ./errorLocalization [xCenter] [yCenter] and will
output a ppm file containing a 1000x1000 epsilon/pixel (where epsilon is the smallest possible 
floating point value) range displaying the difference between the erroneous and rewritten
representations of the difference of squares around xCenter and yCenter. 

More interesting results were obtained in the report with mpfrErrorLocalization. This program 
can be run by calling:

./mpfrErrorLocalization [xCenter] [yCenter] [0=diffSquares, 1=determinant] [0=zero-rounding, 1=difference]

The two provided functions are relatively self-explanatory aside from the fact that
the determinant is made to be a 2-input function by defaulting the "a" value to 2e-31. The two
display modes are zero-rounding (bright highlight of pixels whose values are 0 for the 32-bit
reprentation and != 0 for the 200-bit representation) and difference (simply the difference between
the representations).

Figures 2, 3, and 4 were respectively generated with the following commands:

./mpfrErrorLocalization 2.0 2147483648 1 1
./mpfrErrorLocalization 3.5 3.5 0 1
./mpfrErrorLocalization 2.0 2147483648 1 0
